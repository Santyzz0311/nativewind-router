# Template for Expo Project

This template includes configurations for:
- NativeWind
- ESLint
- Prettier
- React Router
- TypeScript

### For a more comfortable experience with ESLint, you can add this to your VSCode `settings.json`:
You must have the ESLint extension installed.

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll.eslint": true
}
```
